 *  blew web-og's deadline, and got the placeholder cached by the crawler.
 *
 *  Resolve the origin this deployment's own public routes key on: an explicit
 *  PUBLIC_BASE_URL, else the committed PROD_HOST var, else the request's origin.
 *
 *  PUBLIC_BASE_URL is what makes that per-environment. PROD_HOST is committed in
 *  BOTH [vars] and [env.preview.vars] (it gates analytics, which must stay
 *  prod-only), so without an explicit override the preview Worker — and
 *  `wrangler dev`, which loads [vars] — would key on the production origin while
 *  their public routes key on the origin they actually serve. wrangler.toml sets
 *  PUBLIC_BASE_URL for preview; for `wrangler dev`, put
 *  `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787` in packages/web/.dev.vars (README,
 *  "Daily flow", says the same where a dev will actually look). Only the unit

    // On THIS path the opt-out is unconditional, not cold-only, and the flag name
    // reads more conditional than the code is: of the two entry shapes findRelease
    // emits, a TERMINAL prior returns at the fresh exit and a PARTIAL one is either

    // The asymmetry is deliberate: this caller opts out of READING the marker on

    // sharing the slot — the marker describes the HOST being down, not who found
    // it out, and the host is equally down for the human. They get the
    // "checking…" recovery card (never a wrong "not yet released") and can
    // reload; the crawler asks once and keeps what it got. Suppressing the write

  // NO partial is servable to this caller, whichever shape it has. With

  // != 'not yet released'"). WITH a `firstRelease` it is no safer: that tag is the
  // gallop hit, and the bisect that would confirm no EARLIER release contains the
  // commit is precisely what the deadline cut short ("the gallop-found tag is
  // almost always the right answer; bisect just verifies could there be an earlier
  // one", find-release.ts:288-292). "Almost always" is a caveat the result card
  // renders and an OG card cannot. Answering "which release FIRST contains this
  // commit" with a possibly-later release is the one thing this product must not
  // do, so both fall through to the 503: web-og caches the neutral placeholder at
  // max-age=60, which claims nothing and self-heals on the next unfurl, and the
  // permalink it links to still shows the best-effort answer WITH its caveat.
  //
  // resolveLookup hands back a partial it computed less than HARD_TTL_PARTIAL ago
  // rather than recomputing it (see `unpinnable`), so this 503 is throttled to one
  // traversal per 60s per key. Do NOT read that as "the cost is bounded": web-og
  // short-caches the neutral placeholder at max-age=60 and HARD_TTL_PARTIAL is
  // also 60, so for a URL under active unfurling the two cadences COINCIDE and the
  // throttle buys close to nothing. On a repo that reliably blows the soft deadline
  // (GNOME/gimp: large tag set, single-instance relay) the card never converges —
  // it is the placeholder forever — and upstream load for that key goes from ~0 to
  // a full traversal per minute for as long as the link is being unfurled. That is
  // the accepted price of not pinning an unconfirmed answer for 24h; making the
  // card render the gallop hit while keeping it revalidatable needs web-og to
  // short-cache it, which is #156 (adjacent to #151).
